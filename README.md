# October2017
Background material for the October 2017 meet up

Some pointers from Nick 

1. "This [repository](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial) contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating quantum computing using QISKit, the open source quantum information software developer's toolkit. They provide an excellent way to learn, contribute, and collaborate on topics in quantum computing."

2. "[QISKit](https://developer.ibm.com/open/openprojects/qiskit/) lets developers conduct explorations on IBMâ€™s Quantum Experience using a Python interface. This interface enables you to work with quantum circuits and executing multiple circuits in an efficient batch of experiments. To get you started, we have provided example Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate several standard experiments."
